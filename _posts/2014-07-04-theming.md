Theming an app
---

As part of expanding the examples I wanted to be able to have a menu list that will allow the user to change the look-and-feel theme. 
The list of installed themes can be found with `UIManager.getInstalledLookAndFeels`
and will return an array of `LookAndFeelInfo`


Changing the L&F
---

To change the L&F of the whole app then you will need somthing like 

```scala
          def changeLF( newLaF:String ): Unit = {
            UIManager.setLookAndFeel(newLaF)
            SwingUtilities.updateComponentTreeUI(top.peer.getRootPane)
          }
```

_`top.peer.getRootPane` should really be added to the scala-swing api as `top.rootPane`_


Adding more Themes
---
The is a good number of other themes around, with a couple being

- [Insubstantial](http://shemnon.com/speling)
- [WebLaF](http://weblookandfeel.com)

There are several ways to add themes, the most basic is to include them on the command line.

To hard code them into the app then the simplest way is to include them within the installed look-and-feels using `UIManager.setInstalledLookAndFeels`. One thing to note is that this will overrite the currently installed l&fs. so something like 

```scala
  UIManager.setInstalledLookAndFeels( UIManager.getInstalledLookAndFeels ++ Array(
    new UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo("WebLAF", "com.alee.laf.WebLookAndFeel"),
    new UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo("Synthetica", "de.javasoft.plaf.synthetica.SyntheticaStandardLookAndFeel"),
    new UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo("Substance", "org.pushingpixels.substance.api.skin.SubstanceBusinessLookAndFeel"),
    new UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo("Graphite", "org.pushingpixels.substance.api.skin.SubstanceGraphiteLookAndFeel"),
    new UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo("ChallengerDeep", "org.pushingpixels.substance.api.skin.SubstanceChallengerDeepLookAndFeel"),
    new UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo("GraphiteGlass", "org.pushingpixels.substance.api.skin.SubstanceGraphiteGlassLookAndFeel")
  ) )
```

will be needed.
